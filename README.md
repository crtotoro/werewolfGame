Learning by creating a helper app for the fun team building game, Werewolf

This is a side project as I learn html/css/js.  I have enjoyed playing Werewolf (a version of the game Mafia) in team building at work.  
A colleague created some customer town roles so everyone has abilities to consider and I wanted to make it easier for anyone to run the game.
Images are AI generated and I've written the code myself, with some help from ChatGPT along to way when I get stuck or need to learn how to
do something I have never done before.  This project is for personal education first and foremost, with a useful/fun site as a side benefit.

I intend to take this through several iterations:
  1. Assistant to human game master, visible only to game master. Benefit: Anyone can run the game with reminders that make it easy.
  2. Assistant to human game master with screensharing page for game progress overview. Benefit: Same as before plus everyone can see game progress.
  3. Automated game master with player login. Benefit: Everyone can play the game! All actions handled through the UI.
  4. Automated game master with player login and chat features.  Benefit: Play games where you don't even need a Teams or Discord call, though it's probably more fun with audio as well.

Unsure of how far down the list I will make it, but as long as I keep learning from the process I will keep going.
