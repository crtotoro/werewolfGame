# werewolfGame

This is a side project to help me learn html/css/js through the process of creating.  I have enjoyed playing Werewolf (a version of the game Mafia) 
in team building at work.  My colleague created custom town roles so everyone has abilities to consider, but it's much more complicated to run the game.
I aim to make it possible for anyone to run the game and I have plenty of ideas to iterate new features from there.  Images were AI generated via Stable Diffusion 
and I've written the code myself, with some help from ChatGPT along to way when I get stuck or need to learn how to do something I have never done before.  
This project is for personal education first and foremost.  Any useful/fun outcomes are a welcome side benefit.

Here is my plan for versioon iterations:
  v1. Assistant to human game master, visible only to game master. Benefit: Anyone can run the game with reminders that make it easy to manage many roles.
  v2. Assistant to human game master with screensharing page to display realtime game progress. Benefit: Same as before plus everyone can see game progress.
  v3. Automated game master with player login. Benefit: Everyone can play the game! All actions handled through the UI.

Current Goal: #1. Assistant to human game master, visible only to game master. Benefit: Anyone can run the game with reminders that make it easy to manage many roles.
Target Date: 10/20/2023

Unsure of how far down the list I will make it, but as long as I keep learning from the process I will keep going.
